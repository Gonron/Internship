-   React
-   PostgreSQL
-   Graphql

This week was all about getting familier with the above technologies - Most of them i've had experience with before. The new technologies for me was PostgreSQL, Elastic and Kibana.

**PostgreSQL**, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and technical standards compliance. It is designed to handle a range of workloads, from single machines to data warehouses or Web services with many concurrent users

**Elastic**, is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.

**Kibana**, is an open source data visualization plugin for Elasticsearch. It provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster.
